## 15. How do you _deploy a Docker container_ to _Azure Container Instances_?

### Step-by-Step Deployment

1. **Create a Resource Group**: Use the Azure CLI or the Azure portal to provision a new resource group.

2. **Deploy to ACI**: Use the `az container create` command to deploy your container. This process includes uploading your Docker image to an Azure-managed registry.

3. **Access Logs**: Use the `az container logs` command to view container stdout/stderr output.

Azure CLI command:

```bash
az container create \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --name mycontainer \
  --image mydockerimage \
  --cpu 1 \
  --memory 1.5Gi \
  --registry-username <username> \
  --registry-password <password>
```

### Security Considerations

When using Azure CLI ensure that credentials aren't hard-coded in scripts. Use tools like Azure Key Vault instead.erdem#For **deployment using Azure Portal**, navigate to "Container Instances". Click "Add" and fill in the required details. You'll need to provide the image name, resource group, and other configuration settings.

### Code Example: Azure CLI Commands

Here is the `Bash` code:

```bash
# Logging in to Azure
az login

# Create a resource group
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus

# Deploy container to Azure Container Instances
az container create \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --name mycontainer \
  --image mydockerimage \
  --cpu 1 \
  --memory 1.5Gi \
  --registry-username <username> \
  --registry-password <password>

# View container logs
az container logs --resource-group myResourceGroup --name mycontainer

# Delete the container
az container delete --resource-group myResourceGroup --name mycontainer
```
